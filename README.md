# This game is made in Global Game Jam 2017.

In this game, the player tries to avoid the "electric arc fence" by changing the frequency, phase and the shape of the wave that the fence produces.
Player can activate the fence by pressing down space button. You can change the porperties of the wave by arrow keys. 
The blob characters are teleported in from space and are stupid. We need to help them avoid the fence
